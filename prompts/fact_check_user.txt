Review this proposal content for fabricated or unsourced information.

CONTENT TO CHECK:
{content}

EVIDENCE ACTUALLY FOUND IN QDRANT (use this as ground truth — claims not supported here need [Source] or {{placeholder}}):
{evidence}

Instructions:
1. Check every statistic, percentage, count, and specific claim against the evidence above.
2. Any number in the content that does not appear in the evidence and lacks [Source] attribution is suspect.
3. Flag any pricing language — dollar amounts, cost references, savings figures, rate mentions.
4. Verify proof tier usage: T0 claims must be qualified ("Foundever reports…"), T1+ must have [Source].
5. Check commitment clarity: committed delivery, optional enhancements, and future-state must not be mixed in single sentences.
