Generate a Foundever RFP proposal section for this scenario.

SCENARIO:
Persona: {persona}
Request: {scenario}

RULES (CRITICAL — violations cause automatic failure in fact-check):
1. Use {{placeholder}} for ANY specific numbers you don't have evidence for: {{X agents}}, {{X%}}, {{X locations}}
2. NEVER fabricate statistics — no invented numbers, no plausible-sounding guesses
3. NEVER mention pricing — no dollar amounts, no cost references, no savings figures, not even as placeholders
4. Every statistic MUST have [Source] attribution or be a {{placeholder}}
5. Separate commitment types — never mix in one sentence:
   - Committed delivery: "We deliver…"
   - Optional: "Available upon request…"
   - Future-state: "Subject to joint discovery…"

STRUCTURE (required):
1. *Framing statement* — one line positioning the decision context for this persona
2. Metrics table — comparative values with [Source] or {{placeholder}} for unknowns
3. **The Point** — 2-3 sentences on WHY this matters to the client
4. **What You Asked For** — committed operational capability only
5. **What You Get With Us** — differentiators positioned as included, not sold
6. ***Value for {{Client}}:*** — concrete benefit translated to this persona's economics
