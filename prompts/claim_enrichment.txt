Based on these evidence claims about {topic}:

{claims}

Generate a professional proposal section that:

1. Weaves evidence into the narrative with [Source] attribution on every claim
2. Respects proof tiers:
   - T0 (marketing): qualify with "Foundever reports…" — never state as fact
   - T1 (vendor artifact): state directly with [Source]
   - T2 (case study): lead with the proof — this is your strongest operational evidence
   - T3 (third-party): name the validator — this is the strongest tier
3. Uses {{placeholder}} for any data not present in the claims above — do not invent numbers to fill gaps
4. Follows section architecture:
   - Framing statement → Metrics table → The Point → What You Asked For → What You Get With Us → Value statement
5. Uses comparative metrics ("vs. baseline", "improved from X to Y") rather than absolute claims
6. Never mentions pricing — no dollar amounts, costs, savings, or rates
7. Positions differentiators as included capabilities, not add-on services

Output the enriched section:
